Very happy to return again to that city as part of my upcoming USA solo tour. Los Angeles the place where I experienced such an inspiring musical period in 1989 with John and also with his family.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      My tour will be from April 17 until May 11 travelling the country and play eighteen concerts. With such distances I thought the title Poor Wheel would be appropriate for this long trip. Pianist composer Misha Mengelberg, while driving home after a concert in the North of Holland, got a flat tire, replaced it with a small spare wheel and suffered the whole drive from a wheel that according to Misha ‘squeaked and cried softly.’ The beautiful ballad Poor Wheel was born.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Since I first started making music I listened extensively to ballads that were being played by the great saxophonists and clarinetists in jazz history. These inspiring examples became part of my playing, my sound, my language. My most recent solo CD is a salute to that tradition. The compositions and improvisations were inspired by fine musicians like clarinetist John Carter, saxophonist John Coltrane and pianists, composers Duke Ellington, Misha Mengelberg, Carl T. Fischer, Oscar Levant and the wonderful shakuhachi player Watazumi Doso.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      The program for my tour is inspired by this solo CD entitled And She Speaks – A Collection of Ballads. Playing these ballads for the CD was very important to me because it seems that for the first time I really succeeded in bringing together compositions and improvisations in a natural way, that is: going in and out of the material, going in and out of the tradition, to incorporate my own language in these ballads that I have known so long already. Finally I made them mine. And She Speaks is a ballad written by John Carter.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      The beautiful memories of warm, dedicated and inspiring audiences in the USA I experienced during earlier tours… I am looking forward to it.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Hope to meet many USA music lovers and fans again. I will bring my tenor sax, clarinet and shakuhachi: the Japanese bamboo.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Hereby the itinerary: New York, Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Flagstaff, Shreveport, New Orleans, Columbia, Philadelphia\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      For more information: www.stichtingwig.com\n    </TimesBody>\n  </article>\n</Terminal>\n<div class=\"ab_image\">\n  <Terminal title=\"AbPhoto_CQ8.jpg\">\n    <img alt=\"ab\" src=\"./images/AbPhoto_CQ8.jpg\" />\n  </Terminal>\n</div>\n\n<style>\n\n  .ab_image {\n    position: absolute;\n    left: -340px;\n    bottom: -100px;;\n    height: 500px;\n    width: 300px;\n  }\n\n  img {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n\n  .terminal_content {\n    background-color: white;\n    color: #00c900;\n    overflow: scroll;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    padding: 0 18px;\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\n    height: 95%;\n  }\n\n</style>\n",

In bands like Heart of the Ghost, Irreversible Entanglements, and Low Ways Quartet, and as a curator, he’s worked tirelessly to create and promote uncompromising music.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nCatalytic Sound manager Sam Clapp talked with Stewart about his new band Blacks’ Myths with drummer Warren “Trae” Crudup III, his relationship with creative music, his experiments with feedback and collaboration, and the broader project of community uplift through music.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody >\n      <span class=\"question\">Could you talk about how Blacks’ Myths got started?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n     <TimesBody>\n       Trae and I have been playing together for a really long time. In fact, one of the first times we ever played duo together was back in 2011. We did a performance here in DC with Ernest Dawkins, Joe Bowie, Adam Rudolph, and Lewis “Flip” Barnes. That was wonderful. It was one of our first forays into creative music, and it was was sort of our onstage initiation into the legacy and tradition of creative music, as they told us that night.\n     </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      During that performance, during the second set, we all started playing together, and at some point early on in the set, they all sort of left the stage, and left Trae and I to perform duo for the rest of the set. \n    </TimesBody> \n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Was that a surprise?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Yeah it was, it was a total surprise. And apparently, as we were told later by Ernest and Joe, this is what goes on in the AACM tradition. You’re basically left to create on your own. That was my first time to do that as a musician.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Where were you coming from before that? Were you improvising?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nYeah, I was improvising, I was coming from a lot of different musical places at that time. I was still a saxophone player as well as a bass player. I still identified a lot more as a multi-instrumentalist. I was making hip-hop stuff, trying to do DJ stuff, various forms of electronic music in that vein. I had just recently come off of an intense, well, normally intense classical saxophone study in school. I was playing in sax quartets and stuff like that.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nI was a couple of years into doing the jam session thing, and playing straight ahead jazz. By that time I already dove into the world of creative music, but I always come back to that particular experience as an initiation, even though it wasn’t my first foray into improvisation. It was my first foray with an elder in improvisation. That experience was when Trae and I entered into that world together. It’s been like that ever since.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nThe musical synergy between us comes from the fact we’ve played together all the time in various groups. So when we come together it’s very very easy. It’s almost automatic.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Do you talk about what you’re going to do in advance?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nYeah. Everything is pre-determined. The songs have a structure for improvisation, for vibe. The way I like to write in general and especially for this group—it works well with smaller groups—is to create a vibe. A vibe is established and you can build within that vibe as an improviser. That’s what everything is with us.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nWe talk about what we’re gonna play, or maybe I’ll have an idea or a sequence in mind, and I’ll play that, and Trae just creates within it. I might not even tell him anything—I’ll just have it in my head.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">The tracks that are on the album—are these improvised, or semi-improvised?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nWhat you hear on the album is a perfect example. I had a series of ideas in my head—motifs and figures and things like that. And we just went into the studio and played what was in my mind. We just did that like all day, for like 8 hours. But we left room for exploration as well. That’s what you’re hearing on the album.\n      </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Do you identify with the AACM idea of creative music?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nYeah, absolutely. I would say that that way of thinking, especially about organizing, having forays into the community, and ultimately taking control and responsibility over your own creativity, is the biggest lesson that I see from there. I very much identify with that philosophy that they and so many others had at the same time.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">How did you come into contact with that idea of creative music?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nReally from being a listener. From when I was  a young teenager, first getting serious about music and listening to music and investigating the different pathways that different albums take you on. You’ll listen to a particular album and then you’ll see that this bass player is on it, or that this saxophone player is on it, who also has a bunch of crazy albums. Or such-and-such produced it. That help you navigate the different concepts.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nSo though that navigation, in jazz obviously, led me eventually to the Art Ensemble and to Braxton and to Wadada, and then that led me to an investigation of what that music was really all about. Once I moved to DC, I started to meet people who had real life experience with these people who could explain further, and show examples of what they had done, as show examples of how it was a larger movement of self-determination and music for the purpose of community uplift. That sort of jettisoned me into the work that I continue to do.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Do you see your curation and organizing work in that context of community uplift?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nAbsolutely. I would say that a couple of people were really important to that—Bobby Hill in DC is one of them—as well as Tom Porter and Bob Daugherty at WPFW 89.3 FM. The moniker is “jazz and justice.” So you can imagine what’s going on. Those individuals especially showed key things—key books, key recordings, introduced me to people. I met Ernest Dawkins through Bobby Hilll. And Bobby Hill put on that concert I mentioned before. I want to make sure to mention those individuals because they are definitely important and are people who have made a big impact here and in my life.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Can you tell me about Works for Upright Bass &amp; Amplifier? [a piece that explores the feedback generated in the interaction of bass and amp.]</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nI’m very interest in naiveté and a childlike approach to music and the discovery that is possible there, the communication that happens with yourself and the environment and the audience.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">When you’re performing that piece, are you in a normal performance mindset?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nPerforming solo and with a group, for me, is very different, especially with that particular project, that setup. I’m developing a larger performance piece with this concept currently. They are different mindsets, completely.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nThe new [version of the piece] is a performance piece with Miriam Parker, the dancer. We’ve had some very wonderful opportunities to perform. Basically the idea is that we’re encompassing as many sensory elements as possible. We have the sound being generated by myself and an ensemble. She is choreographing movement with other dancers, as well as a visual images with Pat [Cain, video artist].\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nIt was sort of realized last year when we played the New Ear Fest in New York, which was at the Fridman Gallery. It’s a festival of contemporary music, with some legends. We shared a bill with Mary Lucier, who was Alvin’s wife when he was performing I am Sitting in a Room. She had a visual component to go along with that.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      I was generating the sound and light movement needed to make [feedback] happen. Miriam choreographed her own movement. In the same way that I was describing, I set up these improvisational structures, these zones, these vibes, that create an arc for the performance. She also sets up almost literal structures using different material hung on the wall, going from the wall to the floor, using paint on herself, and the way that she moves. And that’s alongside Pat, doing the visual feedback to accompany my sonic feedback.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">I’m curious about how the parts relate to each other, and if that’s a big concern of yours, or if they’re independent elements that are just alongside each other.</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nI like that question because it touches on the classic conundrum of free improvisation with other people. And I consider this, not free improvisation, but improvisationally based. In an ensemble in an improv music situation, is the goal to create independently and in that independence comes together a cohesive sound? Or is the concept that we’re each working together and feeding off of each other and creating a focused sound? Or is it somewhere in between, or is it a combination?\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nFor this particular project for that particular trio, in my mind it’s all sort of building, almost creating a 3-D effect, where you’re getting feedback from the sound and the sonic modulation, and also the cosmic information that travels in the vibration, and then the visual feedback generated by my movement, and then that’s building on the sound, and is a part of the sound. And then you have a moving artist, a movement artist, who is also creating based on the sound and also emitting her own vibration, and then the projections are also capturing that vibration as well. I think as opposed to a traditional music ensemble, with that configuration it’s naturally going to build upon each other, because I’m looking at the dancer, the dancer is listening to me, and the video artist is interacting with us both and drawing inspiration from us both. There’s a lot of that.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nThe process of working with Miriam over the last year has made me much more aware of the movement aspect. It’s not that I need to move with this, or so-called dance with this. The process of generating sound and making the music itself requires it. And I guess the way that it happens is needed in order to physically generate what I want to happen, to actually generate the feedback, which I don’t think is done so much.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Thinking about work that Ben Lamar Gay, Kim Alpert, and Ken Vandermark are doing here in Chicago with feedback, it feels like this interest in feedback could be a reaction to the number of options that we have now musically. You can do so much so easily, that stripping things back is maybe one of the more interesting things you can do.</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Exactly, and especially using feedback with the most normal of setups, which is a bass and an amp. It might seem like a tongue-and-cheek title. But it’s very literal. It’s like, read the words for what they are. People have said it’s amplified bass. That’s different in my mind from bass &amp; amplifier. Because “amplified bass” just means you make the bass louder. If you turn it up really loud, you start to hear the different sub tones and harmonics that come out if you employ different techniques.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Then there’s the element of the amplifier, which is why it’s Works for Amplified Bass &amp; Amplifier rather than works for amplified bass. I’m going up to the amplifier, and twisting knobs, and working with EQ to highlight different frequencies, different pitches within the instrument and within the feedback that’s being generated. It’s almost like a coming together of the pure acoustic sound of the upright bass and the pure electronic sound of the amplifier. And that generates that level of feedback that can then be harnessed and controlled.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      Going back to the independence and codependence concepts in improvisation—when you’re working codependently with a dancer, its a completely different mindset than working with a saxophone player or a musical instrument, or even with a film, or some sort of visual thing.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">How do feel about your journey the last couple of years?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nI think it’s all connected. The last couple of years specifically have been definitely more focused on performance than years on the past, when I was working as a radio producer, as an organizer around music and in other things, in the community. Now I’m working more as a musician, and also writing abut music and finding more ways to evangelize for the music and for this artistic approach, and of its possibilities and applications for more people. That’s always been a part of my philosophy—to be able to explain the music. I have to be able to come up to my parents and the older people in my family about what I am doing. I want connect with you—with the community that is passionate and interested in these concepts—but also wanting to reach more people, to expose more people to this concept, to what’s happening in this world.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Do you feel like you’re able to explain it to your family? Do they get it?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      My mom gets it.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">Is that because your mom is cool, or because you’re explaining it well?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nI don’t know! I think it’s because she’s just seen a lot. And I’ve definitely explained it to her a lot, and she understands. It’s completely foreign to her. She played the violin in school, but she quit that after she left school. So like, she knows music, but she doesn’t have any sort of concept about anything even remotely connected to this world. So yeah, I’m very proud of my mom. And you know, other people in my family, I think they’re all very proud, with varying levels of understanding.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\n      <span class=\"question\">What do you think prevents people from getting it, in general?</span>\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nThere are so many things. I’m not so sure that people straight-up don’t get it. I’m not sure that it’s a thing to get. The way that I’ve experienced art working is when it’s generating a reaction, it’s generating a feeling within somebody, whether that feeling is good or bad. What you don’t want is indifference. Especially reading about the history of the music, and the contemporary innovations in the music, the various battles, aesthetic battles. To take it back to the free jazz conversation, the battles they had to go through with the jazz establishment, the people that, the music industry establishment, the socialite/social scene establishment, all the various macro and micro battles that had to take place. And those people aren’t even remembered, so we can’t even start from that place. We’re starting largely from a place of “Wait, who was that again? And who is this other person?” I think for me it’s ultimately about making people understand that sound has potential for change and development in your state of being as a human. Allowing yourself to be physically and mentally open to allow yourself to evolve, essentially, not in a Darwinian sense, but in your own personal development. And how that can have an impact on you as an individual, and on people as a society.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nThere are so many distractions we’ve created. The mechanisms are strong for us to just retreat into a hole, a personal bubble where your concept of the outside world is through a screen, where you can get things delivered to you. You don’t have to physically do anything, really. People are living their entire lives on laptops, in their room.\n    </TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>\nThe music corresponds to a greater societal battle that we’re engaged in. How to inspire? How make an impact? How to evangelize for this thing that is a pathway, that is a tool for self and collective betterment? How can we create a platform to expose people to that idea, to the point where we can at least enter that conversation a little more, and engaged by more people? How can we avail ourselves of more opportunities to change lives?\n    </TimesBody>\n  </article>\n</Terminal>\n\n<style>\n  .terminal_content {\n    background-color: #fff;\n    color: #00067d;\n    overflow: scroll;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    padding: 0 18px;\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\n    height: 95%;\n  }\n\n  .question {\n    font-weight: 700;\n  }\n\n  .question:before {\n    content: \"# \"\n  }\n</style>\n",

In 2015, the grand piano was part of the collaborative installation 'articulations in space' (Harnik/Richter/Thon) at Rhizom Graz/Austria and has since inhabited the forest of Pairidaeza near Graz at the invitation of Manfred Kummer. In the spring of the following year, I visited the piano for the first time after the exhibition and set out in search of the starting point of its ‘instrumentality,' i.e. the sound of the natural material combination wood-metal, and investigated the traces of sound the story had left behind.\n    </SansBody>\n    <SansBody>\nI was interested in the 'total' of the sound image, i.e. the 'undivided' overall sound that is transferred to the soundboard when the body is struck at different points with a rubber hammer. The strings released from the dampers reacted very subtly to every change of touch and the soundboard amplified the quiet echoes of the past in a complex and uncontrolled way. The sound recordings I made, created in this almost animistic way of approaching the instrument, were played as an installation during the Architecture Summer 2018 via a transducer attached to the soundboard of the piano in the forest of Pairidaeza. \n    </SansBody>\n    <SansBody>\nCan you imagine its sounds?\n    </SansBody>\n  </article>\n</Terminal>\n</div>\n\n<style>\n  img {\n    height: 100%;\n  }\n\n  .text {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: -130px;\n    right: -280px;\n    width: 400px;\n    height: 630px;\n  }\n\n  .terminal_content {\n    background-color: black;\n    color: white;\n    overflow: scroll;\n    font-size: 15px;\n    line-height: 17px;\n    padding: 18px;\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\n    height: 100%;\n  }\n</style>\n",

From September 24th until November 2nd I was touring in Europe with a series of projects, two of which included written material (Exercises, with Håvard Wiik, Christof Kurzmann, and Michael Thieke; and Entr'acte, a band that included Dieb13, Elisabeth Harnik, Steve Heather, Terrie Hessels, Didi Kern, Christof Kurzmann, Mette Rasmussen, Jasper Stadhouders, Joe Williamson, and Nate Wooley, and had a week-long residency in Krakow with rehearsals and small group performances running from October 22nd to 27th, with the full ensemble performing a brand new piece dedicated to Katarzyna Kobro, featuring Christof improvising with, and electronically processing, a series of instrumental combinations.  This meant there was no extra time to work directly on the Stammer Triptych material until I got back home, two weeks before the Momentum 5 performance at Elastic Arts in Chicago on November 14th.\n        </TimesBody>\n        <TimesBody>\n          There were several structural decisions made regarding the Stammer Triptych piece before I left for Europe. The most essential was placing an illustration of \"process\" at the forefront (the composition was directly inspired by the piece I Am Sitting in a Room by Alvin Lucier and the film Film Feedback by Tony Conrad).  I order to do so, I decided to create pre-composed elements that would be presented in a series of three 20 minute segments, along with a video created by Kim Alpert that would be screened and processed in real time, side by side, also three times.  The other primary considerations were the actual personnel: the idea of an ensemble that would be a double quartet with Tim Barnes, Nick Macri, Lou Mallozzi, and Mars Williams representing one of the quartets, and Katinka Kleijn, Damon Locks, Claire Rousay, and myself as the other; the combination of \"clock time\" with \"musical time\"; and providing a parameter that would allow Damon and Lou to only use text-based, spoken word recordings as source material.\n        </TimesBody>\n        <TimesBody>\n          Before leaving for Europe at the end of September, I met with Kim to talk about the technical parameters for the video work involved, which was extremely helpful and triggered a number of new conceptual ideas.  When I returned from my tour, I got together with Damon and Lou to discuss what might be possible regarding their use of pre-recorded and sampled vocal components.  That discussion was also a huge help, particularly in regards to strategies that would prevent any of the fundamental elements of the piece (conventional composition, recordings and processing of voices, and video) from taking precedence over the others from the audience perspective.  This is something that John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Robert Rauschenberg achieved with their collaborations, and I was hoping to accomplish the same with this project as well.\n        </TimesBody>\n        <TimesBody>\n          Once I started the actual operation of composing, I realized that playing the piece in three sequential versions, with breaks in between, would interrupt the idea of \"process\" too severely (both Lucier and Conrad's pieces illustrated the evolution of their materials as an ongoing, continuous evolution).  I therefore chose to add improvised segues between the first and second versions of composed material, and again between the second and third, featuring each quartet separately in these sections.  The structural implications and challenge of this decision were severe- how to create a single, identifiable 20 minute composition that would be transformed twice, with open and improvised interludes, that would last close to 80 minutes in duration.  It meant organizing the longest composition that I had written up until to that point, utilizing elements I had never worked with before, finishing the material and transcribing all the parts in less than ten days; the first rehearsal was scheduled on November 11th and I had arrived home on the 2nd.\n        </TimesBody>\n        <img alt=\"Personnel Stammer 1\" src=\"./images/stammer1.jpg\"/>\n        <small>Personnel Stammer photo 1 (left to right): Ken Vandermark, Lou Mallozzi, Tim Barnes, Nick Macri, Katinka Kleijn [not pictured: Kim Alpert, Damon Locks, Claire Rousay, Mars Williams]</small>\n        <TimesBody>\n          Deadlines are remarkable things.  I'd write in two sessions on most days that week, in the morning and afternoon.  When an idea would run into a dead end, I'd leave it and return to it later- somehow my brain would work on the problem and almost always solve it for me on an unconscious level.  The concept of \"process\" connected itself to my musical thinking as a fugue, and I spent my time away from composing listening to Bach, Nancarrow, Ruth Crawford Seeger, and the Große Fuge by Beethoven.  The first version of the piece featured the strings, with an opening fugue as the initial part, its mirror written as the second part.  This section was followed by a version featuring the horns, which began with a fugue based on the string's \"mirror\" and then concluded with a mirror of that mirror.  Musical time was defined differently in each version, strings in a mid tempo \"waltz,\" horns performing over grooves played on electric bass and constructed from the composed lines for the other instruments.  The third variation combined the written components from the previous two, but with Nick and Mars paired, working from both string and horn themes, and with Katinka and I paired, doing the same but utilizing different parts.\n        </TimesBody>\n        <TimesBody>\n          Throughout the piece, the ensemble followed a clock that designated specific events that would occur at specific times during each 20 minute segment.  This allowed the music to coincide with the length of Kim's video work, and made it possible to integrate the \"musical time\" of notated elements with a \"chronological time\" that indicated the entrances/exits of the recordings/samples of Damon and Lou, plus entrances/exits for improvisers who would be interacting spontaneously with all of this activity.  The places where both the pulse of musical time and the clock of chronological time were abandoned were during the improvised segues, which were completely free for the quartets and unscripted.  The entire composition finished with a coda that was constructed from the electric bass grooves from part two, played by both bass and cello, and finished with the vocal recordings/samples layered on top of each other, over and over again (another nod to the influences of I Am Sitting in a Room by Lucier and Film Feedback by Conrad), while the drums maintained energy and built to the composition's finale.  In any case, that was the plan.\n        </TimesBody>\n        <img alt=\"Personnel Stammer 2\" src=\"./images/stammer2.jpg\"/>\n        <small>Personnel Stammer photo 2 (left to right): Mars Williams, Lou Mallozzi, Kim Alpert, Tim Barnes, Nick Macri, Katinka Kleijn [not pictured: Damon Locks, Claire Rousay, Ken Vandermark]</small>\n    <TimesBody>As mentioned, the first day of rehearsal was scheduled for Monday, November 11th.  Chicago was hit with a snowstorm that morning and Claire and Tim, who were flying in from out of town (San Antonio and Louisville, respectively), were both delayed for more than 12 hours, finally arriving in Chicago but well past the end of the rehearsal time.  Luckily, the string and horn players were able to meet and we got some important, preliminary work done.  Hearing the written components on their own, without percussion or recordings and samples, and without improvisation, was completely nerve-racking for me.  The next day, when Claire and Tim joined the rehearsal, felt much, much better.  On Wednesday the 13th, the entire ensemble met at Elastic Arts to setup and rehearse from 3pm to 9pm.  We were able to leave our equipment in place for the concert the next night, which was a huge advantage for the performance- we could work on all the material and ideas, verify sight lines, get used to the volume and balance in the room, and not have to tear down everything and put it back together the next evening before the gig.  An added bonus was that the recording engineer, Dave Zuchowski, could be there both for the rehearsal and concert so all of his gear was also situated properly.</TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>This is a rough overview of what went into the second half of realizing the Momentum 5: Stammer Triptych project.  It doesn't convey all the effort everyone put into making this endeavor possible, which was extraordinary.  In addition to verifying those contributions, I'd like to note what a success the concert was.  Due to time constraints the music and visuals were never performed in full until the time of the concert.  Despite this, and though my expectations were high, the musicians' performances were exceptional and more than I could have hoped for.  Everyone maintained the necessary creative tension to hold the architecture behind this 80 minutes of music hold in place and, what's more, built its intensity from the start up to and through the finale.  There were so many unprecedented and unscripted moments that the musicians found and put into play- things I could never have anticipated and which would have been impossible to notate in advance.  It was a sensational evening, matched by an incredible audience, I think the largest I've ever played to at Elastic Arts, who matched the ensemble's energy and focus throughout the performance.  My thanks goes out to all the musicians and listeners for their contributions, to Dave Zuchowski for documenting the proceedings, and to Dave Rempis and the staff at Elastic for giving us the opportunity.</TimesBody>\n    <TimesBody>-Ken Vandermark, December 3, 2019, Tokyo</TimesBody>\n  </article>\n</Terminal>\n\n<style>\n  .ken_image {\n    position: absolute;\n    right: -330px;\n    top: 70px;\n    height: 800px;\n    width: 450px;\n  }\n\n  .title-container {\n    width: 70%;\n  }\n\n  .title {\n    font-size: 50px;\n    line-height: 25px;\n  }\n\n  .dark-background {\n    width: 95%;\n    padding: 15px;\n    background-color: #dbdbdb;\n  }\n\n  blockquote {\n    font-size: 18px;\n    line-height: 20px;\n  }\n\n  img {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n\n  .terminal_content {\n    background-color: white;\n    overflow: scroll;\n    font-size: 17px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n    padding: 18px;\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\n    height: 90%;\n  }\n</style>\n",
